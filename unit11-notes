        As you make plans for your Wellness Day, I also want to remind you to stay vigilant in adhering to the public health guidelines in place to safeguard our community. Even as more members of our campus community are vaccinated, it is still critically important to wear masks, maintain social distance and remain in the Central New York region. Please continue to be responsible community members. Your efforts have brought us this far—let’s keep it going!
