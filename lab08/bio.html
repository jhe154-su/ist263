            My name is Jialing He.  I come from China. I am a Public Relations major in Newhouse and a dual major with Information Management & Technology at Newhouse. I have worked at <strong>CitrusTV, a student-run TV station at SU,</strong> for three semesters and serve as Executive Producer and Promotions Director. I am good at storytelling. Outside school, I like watching movies and listening to music. Recently, I am working on improving my cooking skill.
