        <p>Actually, I know the screen reader before, and I kind of know how this could work for the blind people. However, just through the video, the screen reader could be so useful, because it allows the blind people to read or use the Internet to conduct a job or just for fun. Decades ago, being blind seems to be the end of the world, because you will not be able to any things. But now, under the help of the technology, the blind people are also able to conduct normal life. However, the screen reader is still difficult to use for me. The voice is so fast.</p>
