            Mental issues have become a growing problem for college students. The research shows that Generation Z is more likely to feel lonely. More than 60% of the interviewees from this study revealed that they also feel lonely, and no one could understand or care them.<br>
            <br>
            For this website, we want to remind students about the importance of mental health by educating them about the general information of different mental health disorders. We want you to know that it is never your fault to feel bad or depressed. And we are always here to help you. <br>
            <br>
            So here are 5 common psychological mental health disorders faced by young people. <br>

                <h2><strong>Anxiety Disorders</strong><br></h2> 
                The most common category of mental health disorders in America impacts approximately 40 million adults 18 and older. Anxiety disorders cause people to experience distressing and frequent fear and apprehension. While many may experience these feelings, say, during a job interview or public speaking event (as that can be a normal response to stress), those with anxiety disorders feel them commonly and in typically non-stressful events. And bouts of anxiety can last up to six months or more at a time. “Anxiety” is actually a blanket term that includes a host of specific disorders, including:

                Anxiety disorder (GAD)<br>

                <h2><strong>Mood Disorders</strong><br></h2>
                An estimated 1 in 10 adults suffers from some type of mood disorder. While it’s normal to experience mood swings from time to time, people with mood disorders live with more persistent and severe symptoms that can disrupt their daily lives. Depending on the specific disorder, people may experience an ongoing sad, anxious or “empty” mood; feelings of hopelessness; low self-esteem; excessive guilt; decreased energy and more. Therapy, antidepressants and self-care can help treat mood disorders. The most common mood disorders are:<br>

                <h2><strong>Psychotic Disorders</strong><br></h2>
                Those suffering from psychotic disorders may be unable to know what’s real and what’s not. This group of mental disorders changes an individual’s sense of reality. Scientists believe that certain viruses, problems with how specific brain circuits work, extreme stress or trauma and some forms of drug abuse may play a role in the development of psychotic disorders. The most common psychotic disorders include:<br>

                <h2><strong>Dementia</strong></h2><br>
                Although mistakenly thought to be a single disorder, dementia is a term that covers a wide range of specific mental conditions. Those suffering from dementia-related disorders may experience a decline in their cognitive abilities—often severe enough to impair daily life and independent function. While this category includes a host of conditions, Alzheimer’s disease accounts for 60 to 80% of dementia cases. It slowly destroys memory and thinking skills and, eventually, strips the ability to carry out the simplest tasks. Other forms of dementia take the form of:<br>

                <h2><strong>Eating disorders</strong><br></h2>
                Eating disorders are about more than an individual’s relationship with food. They’re complex mental disorders that often require intervention from medical and psychological experts. These conditions cause unhealthy eating habits to develop, such as an obsession with food, body weight or body shape. In severe cases, eating disorders can have serious health consequences and may even result in death, if left untreated. Common symptoms include the severe restriction of food, food binges or purging behaviors, such as vomiting or over-exercising. The most common types of eating disorders include:<br>

            However, international students now encounter a greater challenge. Enormous anxiety and depression are brought when they adjust to a new culture while they are so far away from home. Moreover, the language barrier also impacts their ability to communicate and connect to others. Now the pandemic, with flight and travel restriction, locked thousands of international students in united states. All the factors above only contribute to more pressure on mental health.<br>
